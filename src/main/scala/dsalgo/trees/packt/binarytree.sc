  In a Perfect Binary Tree, the number of leaf nodes is the number of internal nodes plus 1
   L = I + 1 Where L = Number of leaf nodes, I = Number of internal nodes.
  A Perfect Binary Tree of height h (where the height of the binary tree is the longest path from the root node to any
  leaf node in the tree, height of root node is 1) has 2^h â€“ 1 node.
  Above tree has height of 3, so 7 nodes
